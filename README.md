# WARNING: MAY NO LONGER WORK AFTER JULY 2021

The Google Workspace team have recently announced they will change how they render Google Docs. 

"... migrating the underlying technical implementation of Docs from the current HTML-based rendering approach to a canvas-based approach to improve performance and improve consistency in how content appears across different platforms" - https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/05/Google-Docs-Canvas-Based-Rendering-Update.html

This means `GoogleDocsUtil` will no longer work after this change to Google Docs. 


# ChromeExtension-GoogleDocsUtil
When writing a Chrome Extension, in some cases you want to work with Google Docs. 
But working with Google Docs is not easy, it does not follow the normal way of interacting with homepages from a Chrome Extension. 

This googleDocsUtil.js script is made to help interacting with a Google Docs document. It works as a Content Script and should be accessed from another of your Content Scripts.

# Features
- Get the text of the Google Docs document
- Get the caret index in the Google Docs document
- Get the current word at the caret
- Get the user selection in the Google Docs document
- Highlight from/to index in the Google Docs document
- Remove highlight

# Example
Please see ![sample-extension](/sample-extension) for a fully working Chrome Extension which can get the text from a Google Doc page. 

# Usage

```
//contentScript.js

//Get the current state of the Google Docs document. After a change to the google docs document call the getGoogleDocument() again to get the changes.
var googleDocument = googleDocsUtil.getGoogleDocument();

//All the text is in the array googleDocument.text
//NOTICE: if the Google Docs document contains multiple pages, not all the pages may be loaded
var loadedText = "";
for(var i= 0; i < googleDocument.text.length; i++)
{
   console.log("Text at line " + i + ": " + googleDocument.text[i]);
}

//The selected text
console.log("The selected text is: " + googleDocument.selectedText);


//Get the word at the caret
var currentWord = googleDocsUtil.getWordAtCaret(googleDocument);
console.log("The caret is at index: " + googleDocument.caret.index);
console.log("The caret is on line: " + googleDocument.caret.line);
console.log("The caret is at the index on line: " + googleDocument.caret.lineIndex);
console.log("The caret is at the word: " + currentWord);

//Gets the text from index 10 to 20
var foundText = googleDocsUtil.getText(10, 20, googleDocument);

//Higlights the index 10 to 20
googleDocsUtil.highlight(10, 20, googleDocument);

//Removes the highlight
//googleDocsUtil.removeHighlightNodes();

```

# Interface
googleDocsUtil provides the following Interface: 

```
function getGoogleDocument(); /* Returns a googleDocument object used below*/
function findWordAtCaret(googleDocument);
function getText(startIndex, endIndex, googleDocument);
function highlight(startIndex, endIndex, googleDocument);
